          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            My name is Lewis and I am a freelance frontend-focused web developer. I really enjoy designing and developing websites and am trying to make a living out of it to support my family.
          </p>
          <p>
            I attended the University of Kent for my undergraduate degree in Computer Science (Hons), where I graduated First Class. 
            After that, I completed an MA in Games Design at Canterbury Christ Church University. 
            The combinatino of these two subjects allowed me to channel my creativity through programming. 
            I am always trying to learn new things every day and create cool looking things with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst on my undergraduate degree, I learned so much about many different faucets of Computer Science, such as: 
          </p>
          <ul style="padding: 0; padding-left: 0.5vw;">
            <li>Computational creativity</li>
            <li>Algorithms</li>
            <li>Databases</li>
            <li>Neural Networks</li>
            <li>Mobile Development</li>
            <li>Software Development</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, in my final year of my undergraduate degree, I took a module in Game Development, and I fell in love. 
            I had always really enjoyed getting lost in digital games, and this was my chance to see the creative process of developing them.
            I also massively excelled at it, and after my degree was finished I could feel a game design-shaped hole in my heart, so I pursued a Masters in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent a long time around about the time of my Masters using Unity to create games. For my final project I created a VR game where the player competes in a wizard duel.
            They would use the VR controllers as a wand and depending on how they waved it, different spells would cast. I completed this project entirely by myself which involved:
          </p>
          <ul style="padding: 0; padding-left: 0.5vw;">
            <li>Creating 3D models</li>
            <li>Programming</li>
            <li>Using the Unity engine to develop the game</li>
            <li>Playtesting</li>
            <li>Sound design</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I really enjoy game design and programming, 
            however it is rather hard to find a paid, stable job as a beginner, 
            and the pressure of the arrival of my son Atlas forced me to pursue a more imminently possible career. So I went back to my roots from Computer Science.
            I didn't particularly study website creation in University, however I have embarked on a course over the past year learning website programming and have 
            taken quite an interest to website creation and optimisation. It has a fantastic balance of creativity and efficient programming.
